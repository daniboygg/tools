# Project Guidelines

## Code Style

### Indentation
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Never use tabs

### CSS Variables
- Always use CSS variables for consistent theming across a page or tool
- Define variables in `:root` with semantic naming

### Line Length
- Keep HTML lines under 100 characters to avoid horizontal scrolling
- Break long lines at logical points (after attributes, between elements)
- Indent continuation lines to maintain readability
